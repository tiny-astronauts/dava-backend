## Dava Backend

The purpose of this project is to make resolve questions about dosage,
legal notes and events of drugs. It uses the OpenFDA and Google NLP API to formulate an answer. 

#### Installation
Either choose to run `npm install` or `yarn` to get the required
dependencies. If you already have a MonogDB instance running, that
should work otherwise use the included `docker-compose.yml` file to spin
one up. From there `npm start` should spin up the server.
